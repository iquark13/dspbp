# dspbp
Dyson Sphere Program Blue Print Parsing and Modification Tools

## What it does?

This code is used to decode Dyson Sphere Program blueprints, and perform various functions on them (such as changing recipies, or upgrading buildings). After functions are performed on the blueprint, dspbp can then repack all resources and provide you with a valid blueprint string for use in the game!

## Current State

The current code is setup to run in a python intrepreter window using the local file of 'bp.txt' Updates are actively being made to make this more user friendly, but since I have been slowly working on this for quite awhile, actually publishing the repo seemed like it would get me moving a bit faster.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo

    `git clone https://github.com/iquark13/dspbp.git`

2. Paste full blueprint string into `bp.txt`  
    **NOTE:** Blueprint shall be on the 1st line of the `bp.txt` file.

3. Run `blueprint.py` in an interactive intrepreter window.

4. **TODO: :)**
